      The board will automatically reset after saying the word "Spectrum" (as in "Thank you for calling spectrum internet support.").<br>
      To prevent false starts, I won't reset the board more than once every 3 minutes<br><br>
      Points will be added to the total each time the board resets <br>
      The points are only displayed to you in an effort to gamify the process and are not reported to anyone or used in any metrics.<br>
      When accessing this game the site will ask to access your mic, Please allow it this access. Each round you will be given 10 words to say during your call.<br>
      The more of them you are able to say the higher your score will be. At the end of each round, you will gain 10 points for each word you manage to use<br>
      and lose 5 points for each word you are unable to use. this means using at least 4 words will give you a positive score of 10 points<br>
      while using only 3 words will give you a score of -5 points.<br>
      The site also listens for dead air from your side. This dead air is not factored into the score,<br>
       however, when detected it will prompt you with helpful phrases to fill this gap.<br>
      Good luck and have fun!
